=========================================================

---

Daphne, the First Ever Multiple Arcade Laserdisc Emulator is a program 
that lets one play the original versions of many laserdisc arcade games 
on one's PC.

The official website for Daphne is http://www.daphne-emu.com.

As development for Daphne has stopped, this repository is intended as 
something of a continuation until the author decides to do something 
official.
